I installed ghc from source and then I installed the Haskell Platform, which includes Cabal.

The installation was performed locally as a normal user, so I had to add the following to my .profile:

# set PATH so it includes user's private bin if it exists
if [ -d ~/bin ] ; then
    PATH=~/bin:"${PATH}"
fi
#
#
if [ -d ~/.cabal/bin ] ; then
    PATH=~/.cabal/bin:"${PATH}"
fi
#

I'll try to follow this tutorial: http://learnyouahaskell.com/

Some useful git commands:

git push origin master
git pull origin master
git pull origin
git fetch origin
git merge origin/master

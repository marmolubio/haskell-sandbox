I installed ghc from binary in /usr/local.

Then I compiled the Haskell Platform and installed it as root.

I'll try to follow this tutorial: http://learnyouahaskell.com/

Some useful git commands:

git push origin master
git pull origin master
git pull origin
git fetch origin
git merge origin/master
git remote show origin
git log

By default, cabal seems to install package executables in ~/.cabal/bin, even if you do it as root. But one can use the following options to change the default behaviour of cabal install: 

--user                         Enable doing a per-user installation
--global                       Disable doing a per-user installation

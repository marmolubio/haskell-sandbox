I installed ghc from binary in /usr/local.

Then I compiled the Haskell Platform and installed it.

I'll try to follow this tutorial: http://learnyouahaskell.com/

Some useful git commands:

git push origin master
git pull origin master
git pull origin
git fetch origin
git merge origin/master
git remote show origin
git log
